# uSMAART_public
To process and analyze fiber photometry uSMAART data.

This repository aggregates essential pre-processing and analysis code for uSMAART, a fiber-optic-based technology used to measure aggregate fluorescence signal from brain tissues. 
uSMAART can measure up to 2 fluorescent sensor signals from up to two brain areas at once. 
Demo files highlighting processing steps for each situation are provided (1S1A, 2S1A, and 2S2A, for S=sensor and A=brain area).
